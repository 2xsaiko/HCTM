THE FLOATING POINT FORMAT IS AS FOLLOWS:

THE SIGN IS THE FIRST BIT OF THE MANTISSA.
THE MANTISSA IS 24 BITS LONG.
THE BINARY POINT IS TO THE LEFT OF THE MSB.
NUMBER = MANTISSA * 2 ^ EXPONENT.
THE MANTISSA IS POSITIVE WITH A ONE ASSUMED TO BE WHERE THE SIGN BIT IS.
THE SIGN OF THE EXPONENT IS THE FIRST BIT OF THE EXPONENT.
THE EXPONENT IS STORED IN EXCESS 200, I.E. WITH A BIAS OF +200.
SO, THE EXPONENT IS A SIGNED 8-BIT NUMBER WITH 200 ADDED TO IT.
AN EXPONENT OF ZERO MEANS THE NUMBER IS ZERO.
THE OTHER BYTES MAY NOT BE ASSUMED TO BE ZERO.
TO KEEP THE SAME NUMBER IN THE FAC WHILE SHIFTING,
	TO SHIFT RIGHT, EXP:=EXP+1
	TO SHIFT LEFT,	EXP:=EXP-1

IN MEMORY THE NUMBER LOOKS LIKE THIS:
	[THE EXPONENT AS A SIGNED NUMBER +200]
	[THE SIGN BIT IN 7, BITS 2-8 OF MANTISSA ARE IN BITS 6-0].
		(REMEMBER BIT 1 OF MANTISSA IS ALWAYS A ONE.)
	[BITS 9-16 OF THE MANTISSA]
	[BITS 17-24] OF THE MANTISSA]
